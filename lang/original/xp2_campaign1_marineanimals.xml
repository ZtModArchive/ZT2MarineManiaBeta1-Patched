      <TakeThePlungeOverview>
      The owners of a small local zoo have ambitious plans to expand their zoo by focusing on aquatic exhibits. They've hired you to help them take the plunge into the exciting world of marine animals.
         <p/>
         The owners' long-term goal is to acquire ten different species of marine animal for their zoo. As a start, though, they'd like you to begin by acquiring three different species of marine animal.
        <p/>
        (Tip: All the new Marine Mania (???PRODUCTNAME?) animals count as marine animals, but so do some other animals such as polar bears and penguins. If an animal species has tank walls listed in its Zookeeper recommendations, it qualifies as a marine animal for this scenario.)      
      </TakeThePlungeOverview>
            
      <TakeThePlungeSix>
      The owners are quite pleased that you've obtained your first three marine species for the zoo! They've given you a free seahorse bouncy ride to help emphasize your zoo's marine theme. You'll find the bouncy ride crated near the entrance to your zoo.

      The owners have set a new goal for you: display six or more marine species in your zoo!
      </TakeThePlungeSix>
      <TakeThePlungeTen>
      Your zoo now features six different species of marine animals. The owners are so happy with the zoo's new direction that they've given you a free marine gift cart to place in your zoo. You'll find the gift cart crated near the entrance to your zoo.
      <p/>
      To really establish the zoo's reputation as a marine attraction the owners would like you to obtain four more species of marine animal. Display a total of ten different marine species to win the scenario!
      </TakeThePlungeTen>

      <OrcaOverviewShort>Raise an orphaned young orca from childhood to maturity. Complete all the scenarios in this campaign to unlock the ??REWARDITEM.
      </OrcaOverviewShort>
      <OrcaOverview>Individual orcas sometimes strand themselves on shore while hunting prey. Much more rare are mass strandings, where entire pods of orcas strand themselves on the beach. Scientists do not know exactly why these mass strandings occur. 
      <p/>
      Arluq, a young female, is the sole survivor rescued from a mass stranding in the arctic. Currently Arluq is being kept in a temporary facility. Officials of the Orca Rescue and Care Association are looking for a permanent home for her. The association wants to place her in a well-established zoo with adequate financial resources.
      <p/>
      If you can earn $10,000 in donations the association will donate Arluq to your zoo!
      </OrcaOverview>
      
      <OrcaBasicNeeds>You've done an excellent job in raising donations, and so the Orca Rescue and Care Association has donated Arluq the orca to your zoo! You'll find Arluq the orca crated near the entrance to your zoo.
      <p/>
      Now its up to you to take care of this magnificent animal. Build an exhibit for her and take care of all her basic needs.
      </OrcaBasicNeeds>
      
      <OrcaEnrichment>Arluq seems to be adjusting well to her new exhibit. As a reward for your quick action, your zoo's board of directors has awarded you a $10,000 bonus.
      <p/>
      Now you need to make sure that Arluq doesn't get bored! Orcas are intelligent, active predators that require constant stimulation. Your next goal is to obtain three different enrichment items--a bubble emitter, a large ball, and a seal prey dummy--and meet Arluq's stimulation needs.
      </OrcaEnrichment>
      
      <OrcaCare>
      You've done a fine job with Arluq so far! The Orca Rescue and Care Association wants you to continue taking care of her for the next three months. After three months one of their inspectors will assess Arluq's situation and make a recommendation for her future.
      </OrcaCare>
      
      <OrcaReleaseDonations>
      Three months have gone by and an inspector from the Orca Rescue and Care Association has assessed Artluq's current living situation. He's concerned that Arluq's social needs are not being met. Orcas are very social animals, and they dislike isolation. The inspector's recommendation is that you release Arluq to the wild, where she can interact with other orcas. He's confident that this is the best decision for Arluq's future happiness.
      <p/>
      However, transporting and safely releasing a large marine animal like an orca is expensive! Before you can release Arluq to the wild you'll need to raise $25,000 in donation to the orca.
      </OrcaReleaseDonations>
      
      <OrcaReleaseToWild>
      You've raised over $25,000 for Arluq! Now it's time for her to return home. Release Arluq to the wild to complete the scenario.
      </OrcaReleaseToWild>
      
      <OrcaReleaseToWildSuccess>
      You've sent Arluq back to her home waters, far north in the arctic. Using Arluq's vocal patterns scientists managed to locate a pod of related orcas, and Arluq was released back into the wild near her relatives. From Arluq's excited vocalizations and belly-flops you could tell she was pleased to see others of her kind! Arluq joined the pod and is now living happily with them as they patrol the vast ocean.
      </OrcaReleaseToWildSuccess> 
      
      <OrcaBreed>
      Three months have gone by and an inspector from the Orca Rescue and Care Association has assessed Artluq's current living situation. He says that you've done an excellent job raising Arluq in a zoo environment and that it's time to take the next step. He says that you should introduce male orcas and breed Arluq. Once Arluq has a baby you will complete the scenario!     
      </OrcaBreed>
      
      <OrcaBreedSuccess>
      You have a new little arrival at the zoo. Arluq is now a mother! You've started a whole new orca community in your zoo.
