      <welcome>Welcome! In this tutorial you'll learn how to build a basic tank, change its biome, place marine animals, and place a tank filter. When you're ready to begin, click the check button to continue.</welcome>
      
      <openConstructionPanelHeading>Construction Panel</openConstructionPanelHeading>
      <openConstructionPanel>Let's get started! To build a tank, click the Construction button.</openConstructionPanel>
      <openConstructionPanelCompleted>Great! Notice the new Tank Building tab? Click the check button to continue.</openConstructionPanelCompleted>      

      <openTankBuildingTabHeading>Tank Building</openTankBuildingTabHeading>
      <openTankBuildingTab>Click the Tank Building tab.</openTankBuildingTab>
      <openTankBuildingTabCompleted>Building tank walls is very similar to building fences. Just like fences, there are three basic ways to place tank wall--Freeform Tank Placement Mode, Rectangular Tank Placement Mode, and Octagonal Tank Placement mode. Unlike fences, though, you start out in Rectangular Tank Placement Mode. Click the check button to continue.</openTankBuildingTabCompleted>      
      
      <selectAcrylicTankWallHeading>Acrylic Tank Wall</selectAcrylicTankWallHeading>
      <selectAcrylicTankWall>To start building a tank, first click the Acrylic Tank Wall.</selectAcrylicTankWall>
      <selectAcrylicTankWallCompleted>null</selectAcrylicTankWallCompleted>         
      
      <placeTankWallsHeading>Tank Building</placeTankWallsHeading>
      <placeTankWalls>See the large rectangle drawn in the dirt at the end of the path? We're going to place an acrylic tank inside it. Click in the top left corner of the rectangle, near the fountain. Hold the mouse button down and drag to the bottom right corner, near the flower bed. You'll see a preview of the tank as you drag. When the tank is how you'd like it to be, release the mouse button to build the tank</placeTankWalls>
      <placeTankWallsCompleted>Well done! Now let's place a tank entrance and a donation box. Click the check button to continue.</placeTankWallsCompleted>
      
      <placeTankEntranceHeading>Tank Entrance</placeTankEntranceHeading>
      <placeTankEntrance>You'll notice that you now have a tank entrance on your cursor. Rectangular Tank Placement Mode automatically prompts you to place a tank entrance and donation box after you build a tank. Click the tank entrance cursor on the tank wall to place a tank entrance.</placeTankEntrance>
      <placeTankEntranceCompleted>Zookeepers and trainers use tank entrances to get inside the tank. Be sure to always place a tank entrance or else zookeepers won't be able to take care of the animals! Click the check button to continue.</placeTankEntranceCompleted>
      
      <placeDonationBoxHeading>Donation Box</placeDonationBoxHeading>
      <placeDonationBox>You now have a donation box on your cursor. Click the donation box cursor on the path near your tank to place a donation box.</placeDonationBox>
      <placeDonationBoxCompleted>null</placeDonationBoxCompleted>
      
      <raiseTankWallButtonHeading>Raise Tank Wall</raiseTankWallButtonHeading>
      <raiseTankWallButton>You can increase the height of your tank's wall by using the Raise Tank Wall tool. Click the Raise Tank Wall button.</raiseTankWallButton>
      <raiseTankWallButtonCompeted>You now have a circular blue cursor that shows the Raise Wall tool is active. Click the check button to continue.</raiseTankWallButtonCompeted>
      
      <raiseTankWallToolHeading>Raise Tank Wall</raiseTankWallToolHeading>
      <raiseTankWallTool>Click the cursor on the tank wall to raise the tank wall. Click and hold to raise it more.</raiseTankWallTool>
      <raiseTankWallToolCompleted>The Lower Tank Wall button works in a similar way. You can also raise and lower tank walls without using the buttons. Just put your cursor over the top of a tank wall. When the cursor turns into a hand, click and hold to pull the tank wall up or down. Click the check button to continue.</raiseTankWallToolCompleted>
      
      <lowerTankFloorButtonHeading>Lower Tank Floor</lowerTankFloorButtonHeading>
      <lowerTankFloorButton>Now let's make the tank a bit deeper. Click the Lower Tank Floor Button.</lowerTankFloorButton>
      <lowerTankFloorButtonCompleted>null</lowerTankFloorButtonCompleted>
      
      <lowerTankFloorToolHeading>Lower Tank Floor</lowerTankFloorToolHeading>
      <lowerTankFloorTool>The Lower Tank Floor tool works much like the Raise Tank Wall tool. Click the circular blue cursor on the tank floor to lower it. Click and hold to lower the floor more.</lowerTankFloorTool>
      <lowerTankFloorToolCompleted>Good! You can raise tank floors in a similar way. Click the check button to continue.</lowerTankFloorToolCompleted>
      
      <selectLandscapingHeading>Landscaping</selectLandscapingHeading>
      <selectLandscaping>When you first place a tank the water inside it starts out using the biome of the terrain underneath. For example, since we just created a tank on grassland, the water inside the tank is grasslands water. Let's change it to reef water instead so that we can put a manta ray inside the tank. Click the Landscaping tab.</selectLandscaping>
      <selectLandscapingCompleted>null</selectLandscapingCompleted>
      
      <selectFilterBiomesHeading>Filter Biomes</selectFilterBiomesHeading>
      <selectFilterBiomes>Now select the Filter Biomes button to display the list of available biomes.</selectFilterBiomes>
      <selectFilterBiomesCompleted>You'll notice that there are four new biomes just for marine animals--Benthic, Coastal, Pelagic, and Reef. Click the check button to continue.</selectFilterBiomesCompleted>
      
      <selectReefHeading>Reef Biome</selectReefHeading>
      <selectReef>Scroll through the list of biomes and select the Reef biome.</selectReef>
      <selectReefCompleted>null</selectReefCompleted>
      
      <selectDeepWaterHeading>Deep Water</selectDeepWaterHeading>
      <selectDeepWater>Click on the Deep Water button, then click on the water inside the tank.</selectDeepWater>
      <selectDeepWaterCompleted>And there you have it! The tank is now full of nice warm Reef water.</selectDeepWaterCompleted>
      
      <selectPlantsHeading>Decorating the Tank</selectPlantsHeading>
      <selectPlants>Now let's decorate the tank. Click the Plants and Corals tab.</selectPlants>
      <selectPlantsCompleted>null</selectPlantsCompleted>
      
      <selectCoralHeading>Select Blue-Green Coral</selectCoralHeading>
      <selectCoral>We're going to add some blue-green coral to the tank. Click the blue-green coral and then place some inside the tank.</selectCoral>
      <selectCoralCompleted>Good job! Did you know coral is actually a colony of thousands of small animals? Click the check button to continue.</selectCoralCompleted>
           
      <selectAnimalsButtonHeading>Animals Button</selectAnimalsButtonHeading>
      <selectAnimalsButton>You can add more coral, reef rocks, and other decorations to your tank later on, but for now let's move on. We're going to add a manta ray to your tank. Click the Animals button.</selectAnimalsButton>
      <selectAnimalsButtonCompleted>null</selectAnimalsButtonCompleted>
      
      <selectFilterAnimalsHeading>Filter Animals</selectFilterAnimalsHeading>
      <selectFilterAnimals>Now click the Filter Animals button to display a list of biomes.</selectFilterAnimals>
      <selectFilterAnimalsCompleted>null</selectFilterAnimalsCompleted>
      
      <selectReef2Heading>Reef Biome</selectReef2Heading>
      <selectReef2>Now scroll through the lift and select the Reef biome from the list of filters.</selectReef2>
      <selectReef2Completed>You're now viewing only the reef animals. Click the check button to continue.</selectReef2Completed>
      
      <placeRayHeading>Manta Ray</placeRayHeading>
      <placeRay>Click on the manta ray and then place it inside the tank.</placeRay>
      <placeRayCompleted>Good! Now let's add a water filter to the tank and we'll be all done. Click the check button to continue.</placeRayCompleted>
      
      <openConstructionPanel2Heading>Construction Panel</openConstructionPanel2Heading>
      <openConstructionPanel2>Water filters help keep your tanks clean and your animals healthy. Click the Construction button.</openConstructionPanel2>
      <openConstructionPanel2Completed>null</openConstructionPanel2Completed>
      
      <openShowObjectsHeading>Show and Tank Objects</openShowObjectsHeading>
      <openShowObjects>Now click the Show and Tank Objects tab.</openShowObjects>
      <openShowObjectsCompleted>Some of the items here are only used in shows, but the water filter can be used on any tank. Click the check button to continue.</openShowObjectsCompleted>
      
      <placeWaterFilterHeading>Water Filter</placeWaterFilterHeading>
      <placeWaterFilter>Now click the water filter and then place it just outside your tank, right next to the tank wall. Note that you can only place the water filter next to a tank wall!</placeWaterFilter>
   	<placeWaterFilterCompleted>Great! The water filter cleans the water and keeps the tank from becoming dirty. Tank filter need to be maintained by maintenance workers--if not, the filters may break down. You can also repair broken water filters yourself in first person mode.</placeWaterFilterCompleted>

   <xp2_tutorial2>
      <welcome>Welcome! In this tutorial you will learn advanced tank construction techniques that enable you to combine tanks and land into a single exhibit. Click the check button when you are ready to begin.</welcome>

		<hybridTankIntroHeading>Hybrid Tanks</hybridTankIntroHeading>
		<hybridTankIntro>This tutorial will teach you two different ways to make hybrid tanks. Hybrid tanks combine tank walls with land exhibits. They're perfect for animals that live both on land and in water. Click the check button to continue.</hybridTankIntro>
		<hybridTankIntroCompleted>For example, the tundra exhibit with a polar bear you see here is a hybrid tank. We're going to build something similar for the coastal biome. Click the check button to continue.</hybridTankIntroCompleted>
		
		<scrollToCoastalHeading>Coastal Exhibit</scrollToCoastalHeading>
		<scrollToCoastal>There's an empty coastal exhibit with a large pond next to the polar bear exhibit. Scroll over to the coastal exhibit. When you're done, click the check button to continue.</scrollToCoastal>
		<scrollToCoastalComplete>Good! We're going to turn the empty coastal exhibit into a hybrid tank. Click the check button to continue.</scrollToCoastalComplete>
		
		<openConstructionPanelHeading>Construction Panel</openConstructionPanelHeading>
		<openConstructionPanel>First, let's build a tank wall across the pond. Click the Construction Panel button.</openConstructionPanel>
		<openConstructionPanelCompleted>null</openConstructionPanelCompleted>
		
		<selectTankBuildingTabHeading>Tank Building</selectTankBuildingTabHeading>
		<selectTankBuildingTab>Click the Tank Building tab.</selectTankBuildingTab>
		<selectTankBuildingTabCompleted>null</selectTankBuildingTabCompleted>
		
		<selectFreeformHeading>Freeform Tank Placement Mode</selectFreeformHeading>
		<selectFreeform>Now click Freeform Tank Placement Mode.</selectFreeform>
		<selectFreeformCompleted>null</selectFreeformCompleted>
		
		<placeAcrylicTankWallHeading>Acrylic Tank Wall</placeAcrylicTankWallHeading>
		<placeAcrylicTankWall>Click Acrylic Tank Wall, then place a tank wall that connects the fence on one side of the pond with the fence on the other side of the pond.</placeAcrylicTankWall>
		<placeAcrylicTankWallCompleted>Well done! Click the check button to continue.</placeAcrylicTankWallCompleted>
		
		<openLandscapingPanelHeading>Landscaping</openLandscapingPanelHeading>
		<openLandscapingPanel>Now we're going to fill in half of the pond with dirt. Click the Landscaping button.</openLandscapingPanel>
		<openLandscapingPanelCompleted>You may want to change the current biome to Grassland if it isn't already set to that. Click on the check button when you are ready to continue.</openLandscapingPanelCompleted>
		
		<paintDirtHeading>Dirt</paintDirtHeading>
		<paintDirt>Click on the dirt biome brush, then paint dirt over the pond outside the fence and tank wall. Keep painting until all of the water outside of the tank wall is gone.</paintDirt>
		<paintDirtComplete>Good job! The last step is to create a lowered viewing area to permit guests to get a good view inside the tank. Click the check button to continue.</paintDirtComplete>
		
		<selectHabitatHeading>Habitat Editor Tools</selectHabitatHeading>
		<selectHabitat>Click on the Habitat Editor Tools tab.</selectHabitat>
		<selectHabitatCompleted>Did you notice that this panel looks different? It's been re-designed to make it clearer what each tool does. Click the check button to continue.</selectHabitatCompleted>
		
		<selectDitchHeading>Create Ditch</selectDitchHeading>
		<selectDitch>Click on the Create Ditch tool, then paint a ditch along the front of the tank wall.</selectDitch>
		<selectDitchCompleted>That's the idea! Later on you can go back and work on the fine details, like putting a path in front of the tank and smoothing out the path. You can also add some green sea turtles to the exhibit--they really work well in hybrid tanks! Click the check button to continue.</selectDitchCompleted>
		
		<scrollToPelagicHeading>Pelagic Tank</scrollToPelagicHeading>
		<scrollToPelagic>Right now, though, let's learn a different and even easier way to make a hybrid exhibit. Find the pelagic tank next to the coastal exhibit--it's the tank containing a bubble-emitting clam. Scroll over to the pelagic tank then click the check button when you're ready to continue.</scrollToPelagic>
		<scrollToPelagicCompleted>Notice the fenced-in area in back of the tank? We're going to combine the fenced-in area and the tank into a hybrid tank. We can do it in just one step! Click on the check button to continue.</scrollToPelagicCompleted>
		
		<pullDownTankWallHeading>Pull Down Tank Wall</pullDownTankWallHeading>
		<pullDownTankWall>Put your cursor over the top of the back tank wall--the tank wall next to the fenced-in section--and wait for the cursor to change into a hand icon Then hold down the Shift key and click and drag down with the mouse. Pull the tank wall all the way down.</pullDownTankWall>
		<putDownTankWallCompleted>Because you held down the Shift key you only pulled down one side of the tank wall. Now an animal can use both the tank section and the land section of the exhibit. You've created a hybrid tank!</putDownTankWallCompleted>

      <tutorial_complete>
         
         Congratulations! You've completed the advanced building techniques tutorial! Now you can experiment with different kinds of hybrid tanks in your zoo.

   <xp2_tutorial3>
      <welcome>Welcome! In this tutorial you'll learn two different ways to teach marine animals to do tricks. Guests enjoy watching the animals do tricks at marine shows. When you're ready to begin, click the check button to continue.</welcome>
      
      <trainingIntroHeading>Training Animals</trainingIntroHeading>
      <trainingIntro>In Zoo Tycoon 2: Marine Mania you can train certain marine animals to do trained behaviors or tricks. The animals can then perform these tricks in marine shows. Click the check button to continue.</trainingIntro>
      <trainingIntroCompleted>You can train animals in any tank. Only some marine animals can be trained--you can't train a great white shark! Dolphins learn easily, though, and are able to perform all kinds of tricks. Let's teach the dolphin in this tank to do a Jump trick. Click the check button to continue.</trainingIntroCompleted>
      
      <selectDolphinHeading>Select Dolphin</selectDolphinHeading>
      <selectDolphin>Find Beaky the dolphin in the tank, then click on Beaky to select him.</selectDolphin>
      <selectDolphinCompleted>Good! When you select the dolphin you'll see the animal information panel appear in the lower right corner of the screen. Click the check button to continue.</selectDolphinCompleted>
      
      <openTrainingHeading>Train Animal</openTrainingHeading>
      <openTraining>You'll notice some new buttons on this panel just for marine animals. Click on the Train Animal button.</openTraining>
      <openTrainingCompleted>The Train Animal panel shows you all the tricks the animal can currently learn. The Training Level shows how well the animal knows each trick. Right now Beaky knows a little bit about the Jump in Trick Area trick and nothing about the other tricks. Click the check button to continue.</openTrainingCompleted>
      
      <selectJumpHeading>Jump in Trick Area</selectJumpHeading>
      <selectJump>Let's teach Beaky a little something! Click on the "Train Animal" for the Jump in Trick Area trick to enter training mode.</selectJump>
      <selectJumpCompleted>Now we're in close to the action! In training mode you will use the training wand cursor to teach the animal. You do this by tracing a gesture with the training wand cursor. Click the check button to continue.</selectJumpCompleted>
      
      <gestureIntroHeading>Tracing Gestures</gestureIntroHeading>
      <gestureIntro>During training the tracer will move along the gesture line. The gesture line is the large curving yellow line you see in front of you. The tracer is the ring with an arrow attached you see at the left side of the gesture line. Your job is to keep the training wand cursor over the tracer as it moves along the gesture line. Click the check button to continue.</gestureIntro>
      <gestureIntroCompleted>Occasionally you'll have to press special buttons while you're tracing the gesture. In this trick, for example, you have to press the left mouse button at the top of the curve. Other tricks require you to press one of the four arrow keys. Click the check button to continue.</gestureIntroCompleted>
      
      <makeGestureOneHeading>Begin Training</makeGestureOneHeading>
      <makeGestureOne>Ready to give it a try? Click on the tracer to begin training.</makeGestureOne>
      <makeGestureOneCompleted>null</makeGestureOneCompleted>
      <!--NOTE: the tutorial box should disappear after "Ready to give it a try..." and not re-appear until after the training is over.-->
      
      <rewardDolphinOneHeading>Reward Dolphin</rewardDolphinOneHeading>
      <rewardDolphinOne>That's the idea! The trick score tells you how well you did at training the animal. The higher the score, the more the animal learns. After training you reward the animal with a nice tasty fish by pressing the Spacebar.</rewardDolphinOne>
      <rewardDolphinOneCompleted>The animal learns when you feed him the fish. The animal's training level in that trick increases and the animal will perform that trick better. When an animal has mastered a trick it may unlock new tricks for the animal to learn. Click the check button to continue.</rewardDolphinOneCompleted>

      <selectJumpTwoHeading>Jump in Trick Area</selectJumpTwoHeading>
      <selectJumpTwo>Let's try the same trick again so we can learn some advanced techniques. Click on the "Train Animal" for the Jump in Trick Area trick to enter training mode.</selectJumpTwo>
      <selectJumpTwoCompleted>If you keep a close eye on the tracer as it moves you'll notice it shoots out little sparks. Pay attention to the color of the sparks! Green sparks mean you're right on top of the gesture tracer and doing well. Yellow and orange sparks mean you're falling a little behind. Red sparks mean that you're not earning any points at all because your cursor is too far away from the tracer! Click the check button to continue.</selectJumpTwoCompleted>
      
      <makeGestureTwoHeading>Begin Training</makeGestureTwoHeading>
      <makeGestureTwo>Ready to try it again? Remember to keep a close eye on the tracer! Click on the tracer to begin training.</makeGestureTwo>
      <makeGestureTwoCompleted>null</makeGestureTwoCompleted>
      <!--NOTE: the tutorial box should disappear after "Ready to give it a try..." and not re-appear until after the training is over.-->      
      
      <rewardDolphinTwoHeading>Reward Dolphin</rewardDolphinTwoHeading>
      <rewardDolphinTwo>Good! Now reward Beaky with a fish by pressing the Spacebar.</rewardDolphinTwo>
      <rewardDolphinTwoCompleted>The more you train an animal in one trick, the better he becomes at it. The better the animal is at a trick, the harder it becomes to train that trick further. Each trick has three levels of difficulty for the gestures you will have to trace. As you move from one difficulty to the next you may find that that the tracer moves faster, there are more special buttons to press, or the shape of the gesture itself changes. Click the check button to continue.</rewardDolphinTwoCompleted> 
      
      <closePanelHeading>Close Train Animal Panel</closePanelHeading>
      <closePanel>In addition to training animals yourself you can also hire trainers to train animals for you. Let's learn how to use trainers. First, close the Train Animal panel.</closePanel>
      <closePanelCompleted>null</closePanelCompleted>
      
      <openStaffPanelHeading>Staff</openStaffPanelHeading>
      <openStaffPanel>The trainer is a new type of staff member, like zookeepers or educators. Click on the Staff button to open the staff panel.</openStaffPanel>
      <openStaffPanelCompleted>null</openStaffPanelCompleted>
      
      <placeTrainerHeading>Place Trainer</placeTrainerHeading>
      <placeTrainer>Now click on the trainer icon to get a trainer on your cursor. Click again in the game world to place the trainer.</placeTrainer>
      <placeTrainerCompleted>Trainers operate very much like zookeepers. A trainer without any special assignments will automatically look for marine animals to train. A marine animal must be happy and must be able to learn tricks before a trainer will train it. Click the check button to continue.</placeTrainerCompleted>
      
      <selectTrainerHeading>Select Trainer</selectTrainerHeading>
      <selectTrainer>You can also assign a trainer to train a specific animal or animals. To assign a trainer, first click on the trainer to select him or her.</selectTrainer>
      <selectTrainerCompleted>null</selectTrainerCompleted>
      
      <selectTrainingTabHeading>Training Assignments Tab</selectTrainingTabHeading>
      <selectTrainingTab>Now click on the Training Assignments tab.</selectTrainingTab>
      <selectTrainingTabCompleted>Here you can add specific animals you want this trainer to train. Click the check button to continue.</selectTrainingTabCompleted>
      
      <clickAddAssignmentHeading>Add New Assignment</clickAddAssignmentHeading>
      <clickAddAssignment>Click the Add New Assignment button to obtain the training assignment cursor, then click the training assignment on Beaky the dolphin.</clickAddAssignment>
      <clickAddAssignmentCompleted>Good work! Beaky's name now appears on the assignment list and the trainer will now teach Beaky tricks. When you use a trainer you don't choose the tricks yourself. The trainer will go through all the tricks available to the animal starting with the easiest ones. Click on the check button to continue.</clickAddAssignmentCompleted>
      
      <trainingMultipleAnimalsHeading>Training Multiple Animals</trainingMultipleAnimalsHeading>
      <trainingMultipleAnimals>You can assign a trainer to train multiple animals in multiple tanks. Of course the more animals you assign to a trainer the less time the trainer will have to spend with each animal. Also, if you assign a trainer to animals in different tanks then it will take some time for the trainer to walk between tanks. Click on the check button to continue.</trainingMultipleAnimals>
      <trainingMultipleAnimalsComplete>Trainers are only able to train animals in tanks that have tank entrances--that is, a ladder and a platform. Click the check</trainingMultipleAnimalsComplete>

      <welcome>Welcome! In this tutorial you'll learn how to create and schedule exciting marine shows for your guests to enjoy. When you're ready to begin, click the check button to continue.</welcome>

		<showIntroHeading>Show Tanks</showIntroHeading>
		<showIntro>To create a marine show the first thing you need is a show tank. A show tank is different from a regular tank in two respects. First, while marine animals can perform inside a show tank, they cannot live inside one. It's hard to eat or rest when there's a show going on inside your house! Second, every show tank needs a show platform. Click the check button to continue.</showIntro>
		<showIntroCompleted>There are three tanks in this zoo. There's a dolphin in one tank and an orca in another, but the tank in the middle is empty. That means it's perfect for a show tank! We're going to turn the middle tank into a show tank and create shows using the dolphin and the orca. Click the check button to continue.</showIntroCompleted>
		
      <openConstructionPanelHeading>Construction Panel</openConstructionPanelHeading>
      <openConstructionPanel>To create a show tank you need to place a show platform inside it. First, click the Construction button.</openConstructionPanel>
      <openConstructionPanelCompleted>The show platform can be found on the new Show and Tank Objects panel. Click the check button to continue.</openConstructionPanelCompleted>
      
      <openShowObjectsHeading>Show and Tank Objects</openShowObjectsHeading>
      <openShowObjects>Now click the Show and Tank Objects tab.</openShowObjects>
      <openShowObjectsCompleted>mull.</openShowObjectsCompleted>
      
      <placeShowPlatformHeading>Show Platform</placeShowPlatformHeading>
      <placeShowPlatform>Click the show platform to get it on your cursor, then click again inside the tank to place it. Note that you can only place the show platform next to a tank wall.</placeShowPlatform>
      <placeShowPlatformCompleted>The MC runs shows from the show platform. You also use the show platform to schedule your shows. Click the check button to continue.</placeShowPlatformCompleted>
      
		<!--Large Grandstand is also known as Grandstand III-->      
		<placeGrandstandHeading>Large Grandstand</placeGrandstandHeading>
		<placeGrandstand>Now let's add a grandstands so that guests have somewhere to sit and watch the show. We want to put it in front of the show tank with the seats facing the tank--in between the four flower beds is a nice spot. Click on the large grandstand to get it on your cursor, then click again in the game world to place it.</placeGrandstand>
		<placeGrandstandCompleted>Good! Now let's connect the animal tanks to the show tank. Click the check button to continue.</placeGrandstandCompleted>
		
		<placeDolphinPortalHeading>Show Portal</placeDolphinPortalHeading>
		<placeDolphinPortal>Show portals are used to connect tanks with animals in them to show tanks. Animals swim through them to travel to show platforms when it's time to perform. Let's connect the dolphin tank to the show tank using a show portal. Click on the show portal icon to get the show portal on your cursor then click again on the tank wall between the dolphin tank and the show tank.</placeDolphinPortal>
		<placeDolphinPortalCompleted>Now the dolphin will swim into the show platform when he's performing in a show. Note that you can only place show portals on show tank walls. Click the check button to continue.</placeDolphinPortalCompleted>
		
		<placeOrcaPortalHeading>Show Portal</placeOrcaPortalHeading>
		<placeOrcaPortal>Now let's connect the orca tank to the show tank. Click on the show portal icon to get it on your cursor then click again on the tank wall between the orca tank and the show tank.</placeOrcaPortal>
		<placeOrcaPortalCompleted>Animals will only use show portals when they're scheduled to perform in shows, so you don't need to worry about the orca swimming over to the dolphin tank and attacking your dolphin! Click on the check button to continue.</placeOrcaPortalCompleted>

      <selectLandscapingHeading>Landscaping</selectLandscapingHeading>
      <selectLandscaping>Right now the show tank contains grasslands water. We need to change the biome of the water inside the tank to something that both of our show animals will like. Click the Landscaping tab.</selectLandscaping>
      <selectLandscapingCompleted>null</selectLandscapingCompleted>

      <selectFilterBiomesHeading>Filter Biomes</selectFilterBiomesHeading>
      <selectFilterBiomes>Now select the Filter Biomes button to display the list of available biomes.</selectFilterBiomes>
      <selectFilterBiomesCompleted>Most of the show animals are comfortable in Coastal water, so we'll use that. Click the check button to continue.</selectFilterBiomesCompleted>
      
      <selectCoastalHeading>Coastal Biome</selectCoastalHeading>
      <selectCoastal>Scroll through the list of biomes and select the Coastal biome.</selectCoastal>

      <selectDeepWaterHeading>Deep Water</selectDeepWaterHeading>
      <selectDeepWater>Click on the Deep Water button, then click on the water inside the tank.</selectDeepWater>
      <selectDeepWaterCompleted>Both the dolphin and the orca will now be comfortable performing in the show tank. Click the check button to continue.</selectDeepWaterCompleted>
		
		<selectShowPlatformHeading>Select Show Platform</selectShowPlatformHeading>
		<selectShowPlatform>Now let's put on a show! To create a show, click on the show platform.</selectShowPlatform>
		<selectShowPlatformCompleted>The show platform information panel allows you to edit, delete, and re-order shows. First, though, you need to create one! Click on the check button to continue.</selectShowPlatformCompleted>

		<createShowHeading>Create Show</createShowHeading>
		<createShow>Click the Create Show button.</createShow>
		<createShowCompleted>You now see the show mixer. The show mixer allows you to have one animal perform multiple tricks during a show or even have multiple animals performing tricks at the same time. We're going to create a simple show using the dolphin and the orca. Click the check button to continue.</createShowCompleted>
		
		<chooseAnimalOneHeading>Choose Animal</chooseAnimalOneHeading>
		<chooseAnimalOne>First add the bottlenose dolphin to the show. Click Choose Animal then select the bottlenose dolphin from the list.</chooseAnimalOne>
		<chooseAnimalOneCompleted>Note that the list only includes animals in tanks that are connected to the show tank by a show portal. Click the check button to continue.</chooseAnimalOneCompleted>
		
		<chooseAnimalTwoHeading>Choose Animal</chooseAnimalTwoHeading>
		<chooseAnimalTwo>Let's have the orca perform in the show too. Click Choose Animal then select the orca from the list.</chooseAnimalTwo>
		<chooseAnimalTwoCompleted>Now that we have both animals in the show let's assign them to perform tricks. For act one of the show let's have the orca and the dolphin do the Jump trick at the same time. Click the check button to continue.</chooseAnimalTwoCompleted>
		
		<assignAnimalOneTrickOneHeading>Add New Trick</assignAnimalOneTrickOneHeading>
		<assignAnimalOneTrickOne>First assign the bottlenose dolphin to do the Jump trick. Click the dolphin's Add New Trick button and then select the Jump trick from the list.</assignAnimalOneTrickOne>
		<assignAnimalOneTrickOneCompleted>When you assign a trick to an animal the show automatically creates a trick area--a ring of buoys--where the animal will perform. You can pick up the trick area and move it to exactly where you want it. You can do the same thing with most of the other show props a trick may use. Click on the check button to continue.</assignAnimalOneTrickOneCompleted>
		
		<assignAnimalTwoTrickHeading>Add New Trick</assignAnimalTwoTrickHeading>
		<assignAnimalTwoTrick>Now that we have the dolphin's first trick scheduled, let's do the same thing for the orca. Click the orca's Add New Trick button and then select the Jump trick from the list.</assignAnimalTwoTrick>
		<assignAnimalTwoTrickCompleted>When the show starts the dolphin and the orca will now do the Jump trick at the same time. Click the check button to continue.</assignAnimalTwoTrickCompleted>
		
		<assignAnimalOneTrickTwoHeading>Add New Trick</assignAnimalOneTrickTwoHeading>
		<assignAnimalOneTrickTwo>For act two of our show let's have the bottlenose dolphin do the Water Walk trick. Click the dolphin's Add New Trick button and then select "Reuse Prop for Water Walk" from the list.</assignAnimalOneTrickTwo>
		<assignAnimalOneTrickTwoCompleted>Note that you can re-name your show to something like "Dolphin and orca show" if you think "Show 1" is too boring. Click on the check button to continue.</assignAnimalOneTrickTwoCompleted>
		
		<saveShowHeading>Save and Exit</saveShowHeading>
		<saveShow>Now click on the check button on the Show Mixer to save the show and exit the Show Mixer.</saveShow>
		<saveShowCompleted>There are just a couple more things to do and then you can see your show in action! Click the check button to continue.</saveShowCompleted>
		
		<insertBreakHeading>Insert Break</insertBreakHeading>
		<insertBreak>Animals need to take some time off from shows. If an animal spends too much time performing it will become unhappy, and unhappy animals will refuse to perform! To keep the dolphin and the orca happy, insert a break after the show so they can get some rest. Click on the Insert Break button.</insertBreak>
		<insertBreakCompleted>Now we're ready to start the show! Click the check button to continue.</insertBreakCompleted>
		
		<openShowHeading>Open Show Platform</openShowHeading>
		<openShow>Click the Open Show Platform button to open the show platform and start the show.</openShow>
		<openShowCompleted>Now sit back and enjoy the show you made. (If you want to you can even sit in the grandstands while in Zoo Guest Mode!) When the show platform is open all the shows scheduled will run in order--Show 1, then Show 2, and so on. Once all the shows have played, the cycle will begin again with Show 1.</openShowCompleted>
		
		<showOutroHeading>Editing Shows</showOutroHeading>
		<showOutro>You can use the show platform panel to add additional shows, edit existing shows, delete shows, or re-order shows--but you have to close the show platform first. To change shows, close the platform, make your changes, and then open the show platform again. Click the check button to continue.</showOutro>
		<showOutroCompleted>Guests rate the shows they've seen on a star system. The more stars the better they like the show. Guests will donate to your zoo if they like your show, so be sure to put a donation box near the show tank. Click the check button to continue.</showOutroCompleted>

   <xp2_tutorial5>

      <welcome>Welcome! In this tutorial you'll learn about some of the new features in Zoo Tycoon 2: Marine Mania such as terrain feature filters, the eyedropper tool, and swimming with dolphins. When you're ready to begin, click the check button to continue.</welcome>
      
      <!--Ideally we would force the terrain feature filters to all be ON here via script...otherwise, we can't be guaranteed which are on and which are off.-->
      
		<openLandscapingHeading>Landscaping</openLandscapingHeading>
		<openLandscaping>Zoo Tycoon 2: Marine Mania features several new features as well as some changes to old ones. One thing that's changed is the way you paint landscape features like trees and rocks. To see the new method, click on the Landscaping button.</openLandscaping>
		<openLandscapingCompleted>Now select the desert biome. Click on the check button to continue once you have selected the desert biome.</openLandscapingCompleted>
		
		<paintLandscapeOneHeading>Paint Landscape</paintLandscapeOneHeading>
		<paintLandscapeOne>The layout of the Landscaping panel has changed. You no longer paint foliage and rocks by selecting biome brushes at the bottom of the panel. Instead you use the new terrain feature filters to toggle trees, plants, and rocks on and off. To see how this works, paint down some desert inside the large field of dirt surrounded by flower beds near the zoo entrance.</paintLandscapeOne>
		<paintLandscapeOneCompleted>Right now all three terrain feature filters are turned on, so when you paint down landscape you're also painting down rocks, trees, and plants. Click on the check button to continue.</paintLandscapeOneCompleted>
		
		<toggleRocksHeading>Rocks Filter</toggleRocksHeading>
		<toggleRocks>You can turn any or all of these filters off. Click on the rocks filter to turn it off.</toggleRocks>
		<toggleRocksCompleted>null</toggleRocksCompleted>
		
		<paintLandscapeTwoHeading>Paint Landscape</paintLandscapeTwoHeading>
		<paintLandscapeTwo>Now paint down some more desert landscape.</paintLandscapeTwo>
		<paintLandscapeTwoCompleted>Since the rocks filter is off, rocks now no longer appear when you paint landscape. The terrain feature filters give you precise control over what does and doesn't get painted. Click on the check button to continue.</paintLandscapeTwoCompleted>
		
		<selectTreeHeading>Select Tree</selectTreeHeading>
		<selectTree>Another new feature is the eyedropper tool. The eyedropper tool is a quick and easy way to place another copy of almost any object in the game. Let's try it out on the balsam fir tree over by the hamburger stand. Click on the balsam fir tree to select it.</selectTree>
		<selectTreeCompleted>null</selectTreeCompleted>
		
		<copyTreeHeading>Eyedropper Tool</copyTreeHeading>
		<copyTree>Now click on the eydropper tool to get another balsam fir tree on your cursor, then click again to place the red cedar tree.</copyTree>
		<copyTreeCompleted>The eyedropper may not work on certain objects. For example, in a campaign or scenario game the eyedropper tool won't work if you don't have enough zoo fame for the object, or if the item requires research and you haven't researched it yet. Click on the check button to continue.</copyTreeCompleted>
		
		<!--note we may have to force manta to be on buy panel-->
		<selectMantaRayHeading>Select Manta Ray</selectMantaRayHeading>
		<selectMantaRay>There's also a similar tool which allows you to "clone" animals. Find the manta ray tank and then click on a manta ray to select it.</selectMantaRay>
		<selectMantaRayCompleted>null</selectMantaRayCompleted>
		
		<selectRecommendationsHeading>Zookeeper Recommendations</selectRecommendationsHeading>
		<selectRecommendations>Click on the zookeeper recommendations button to bring up the zookeeper recommendations panel.</selectRecommendations>
		<selectRecommendationsCompleted>null</selectRecommendationsCompleted>
		
		<clickPictureHeading>Clone Animal</clickPictureHeading>
		<clickPicture>Click on the picture of the manta ray on the zookeeper recommendations panel to get another manta ray on your cursor, then click again in the manta ray tank to place it.</clickPicture>
		<clickPictureCompleted>This shortcut will only work if the animal is available on the adoption panel. In a scenario or challenge game you may not be able to "clone" an animal if it's not currently displayed on the adoption panel. Click on the check button to continue.</clickPictureCompleted>
		
		<openQuickStatsHeading>Zoo Quick Stats</openQuickStatsHeading>
		<openQuickStats>Zoo Tycoon 2: Marine Mania also has some new ways to gather information about your zoo. Click on the Zoo Quick Stats button to open the Quick Stats panel.</openQuickStats>
		<openQuickStatsCompleted>There are two new tabs on the Quick Stats panel--the Building Information tab and the Donation Box Information tab.</openQuickStatsCompleted>
		
		<selectBuildingTabHeading>Building Information</selectBuildingTabHeading>
		<selectBuildingTab>The Buildings List gives you easy access to information on all the buildings in your zoo. You can see at a glance how long each building has been open, its total profit to date, and its average profit per month. Click on the Building Information tab to open the Buildings List.</selectBuildingTab>
		<selectBuildingTabCompleted>Just like the other lists on the Quick Stats panel, clicking on a building's name takes you right to that building. The new Donation Box tab works in a similar way for donation boxes. Click on the check button to continue.</selectBuildingTabCompleted>
		
		<selectDolphinHeading>Select Dolphin</selectDolphinHeading>
		<selectDolphin>One fun new feature is being able to swim with dolphins and other marine animals. Find the dolphin tank and click on one of the dolphins to select it.</selectDolphin>
		<selectDolphinCompleted>The Swim With Animal feature allows you to enter a dolphin exhibit and swim alongside these magnificent animals. Click the check button to continue.</selectDolphinCompleted>
		
		<clickSwimButtonHeading>Swim With Animal</clickSwimButtonHeading>
		<clickSwimButton>Click the Swim With Animal button to siwm with the dolphin.</clickSwimButton>
		<clickSwimButtonCompleted>Enjoy riding along with the dolphin! Click the check button when you're ready to continue</clickSwimButtonCompleted>
		
		<!--Note the player is already in Zoo Guest Mode at this point-->
		<clickOverheadViewHeading>Swimming in Zoo Guest Mode</clickOverheadViewHeading>
		<clickOverheadView>You can swim in tanks and dive underwater in Zoo Guest Mode. Swimming works very much like walking around your zoo in Zoo Guest Mode. (Note that you can use the mouse's scroll wheel to dive or ascend while swimming.) Try swimming in the dolphin tank for a while. Click on the Overhead View button when you're ready to continue.</clickOverheadView>
		<clickOverheadViewCompleted>You can even take photos while you're swimming underwater! Click on the check button to continue.</clickOverheadViewCompleted>
		
		<ballPhysicsHeading>Improved Ball Physics</ballPhysicsHeading>
		<ballPhysics>There's one more fun little feature to see. Find the circular pit surrounded by pursuit balls--it's near the back of the zoo. Click the check button when you have found the pit.</ballPhysics>
		<ballPhysicsCompleted>Zoo Tycoon 2: Marine Mania features improved ball physics. What that means is that the balls and animal toys in the game roll better and bounce better than ever before! To try it out, drop some of the balls into the pit and watch how they roll. Click on the check button when you're done playing with the pursuit balls.</ballPhysicsCompleted>
